**Frontend Final Summary**

Overview
-------
This frontend is a modern, responsive Vue 3 Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to visualize and manage pasture data generated by the backend NoSQL stack. It prioritizes fast load times, offline capability, and a clean, usable interface for the main workflows: monitoring fields, viewing analytics, handling alerts, and configuring settings.

Key Features
------------
- Vue 3 (Composition API) bootstrapped with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, utility-first styling and a custom agricultural (emerald) theme.
- PWA support: manifest, service worker (via Vite PWA plugin), and add-to-home-screen shortcuts.
- Responsive layout with desktop and mobile navigation (header + bottom mobile nav).
- Five main views: Dashboard, Fields, Analytics, Alerts, Settings.
- Global Axios `apiClient` for connecting to the backend API; ready for authentication and interceptors.
- Skeletons and placeholders for Chart.js and Leaflet map integrations (easy to enable when backend API is available).

File Locations (important)
--------------------------
- `frontend/src/App.vue` — root shell with header, theme toggle, and router-view.
- `frontend/src/main.js` — app bootstrap, Pinia (planned), router registration, PWA registration.
- `frontend/src/router/index.js` — routes for the five views.
- `frontend/src/api/client.js` — configured Axios instance for `VITE_API_URL`.
- `frontend/src/style.css` — global Tailwind helpers and small component classes (`card`, `btn`, `badge`).
- `frontend/src/views/` — `Dashboard.vue`, `Fields.vue`, `Analytics.vue`, `Alerts.vue`, `Settings.vue` (fully scaffolded, UI-ready).
- `frontend/public/manifest.json` — PWA manifest and icons.

Run & Development
-----------------
1. From `frontend/` install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Dev server: `http://localhost:5173` (HMR enabled)

2. Production build and preview:
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

Environment
-----------
- Create `.env.local` in `frontend/` with `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your backend (default `http://localhost:8000`).
- PWA uses `public/manifest.json`; service worker configuration is in `vite.config.js` (VitePWA plugin).

Backend Integration Points
--------------------------
The frontend expects the backend REST API to provide the following endpoints (update `VITE_API_URL` accordingly):

- `GET /api/fields` — list fields and latest metrics
- `GET /api/fields/{id}` — field details and geometry
- `GET /api/fields/{id}/timeseries` — time-series sensor data (Cassandra)
- `GET /api/fields/{id}/metrics` — aggregated metrics (Redis)
- `GET /api/alerts` — active alerts
- `POST /api/alerts/{id}/read` — mark alert as read
- `GET /api/graph/events` — Neo4j event relationships

Design Notes & UX
-----------------
- Dark mode toggle persists in `localStorage` and respects system preference.
- Mobile navigation provided via a bottom nav for quick access to primary routes.
- Cards, badges, and metrics use Tailwind-based utility classes for consistent spacing and theming.
- The map and charts are intentionally decoupled from the UI scaffolding so they can be integrated progressively as backend endpoints become available.

Deployment
----------
- Frontend deploy options: Vercel (recommended), Netlify, Docker+Nginx, S3+CloudFront.
- Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set to the production backend URL and HTTPS is enabled (PWA requires HTTPS).
- For containerized deploy, the multi-stage Dockerfile already exists at project root and copies the built frontend into `static/` for the backend image.

Next Steps
----------
1. Implement the backend REST API (FastAPI suggested) with the endpoints above.
2. Hook Chart.js into `Analytics.vue` and Leaflet into `Dashboard.vue` once the API provides time-series and geometry data.
3. Add Pinia stores for shared state (fields store, alerts store, ui store).
4. Add E2E tests (Cypress) and unit tests (Vitest) for key components.
5. Add WebSocket or SSE support for real-time alert push notifications.
